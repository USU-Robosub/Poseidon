Software for the Mark II autonomous submarine.

This submarine is the third generation of the Robosub, built by the mechanical, electronic, and software engineers at Utah State University.

Unlike the previous versions, this submarine itself was planned by the engineers, designed in a computer, and fabricated by machines. The quality of this sub sets it apart from the previous generations. We hope that the software is designed with the same care and precision as well.
